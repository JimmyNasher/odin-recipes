    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pelmeni, originating from Russia, are savory dumplings that encapsulate the essence of comfort food. These small, doughy parcels are typically filled with a mixture of minced meat, such as beef, pork, or a combination, seasoned with salt and pepper. The dumplings are meticulously crafted, featuring thin, unleavened dough enveloping the flavorful filling.</p>
    <p>Pelmeni are known for their distinctive shape—tiny, folded pockets resembling a twisted hat or ear—and are traditionally served boiled or sometimes pan-fried for a crisp texture. Often enjoyed with a dollop of sour cream or a drizzle of melted butter, pelmeni offer a satisfying combination of hearty flavors and a simple yet irresistible culinary experience that transcends generations and cultural borders.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3><em>Prepare the Dough:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the centre and add the egg.</li>
        <li>Gradually add water, mixing continuously until a dough forms</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, chopped onion, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>Assemble the Pelmeni:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it's about 1/16 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles from the dough</li>
        <li>Place a small amount of filling in the centre of each dough circle</li>
        <li>Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape, then pinch the edges to seal, creating a hat-like or ear-like shape.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>Cook the Pelmeni:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil</li>
        <li>Carefully drop the pelmeni into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface (usually 3-5 minutes)</li>
        <li>Remove the pelmeni with a slotted spoon and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>Serve:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pelmeni can be served with a side of sour cream, melted butter, or a sprinkle of fresh herbs</li>
